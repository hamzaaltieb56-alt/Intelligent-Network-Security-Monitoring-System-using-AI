# Intelligent Network Security Monitoring System using AI 🛡️🤖

A comprehensive network security monitoring system that leverages Machine Learning (Isolation Forest & Random Forest) to detect anomalies and classify cyber attacks in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis**: Processes network data to identify suspicious patterns live.
- **AI-Driven Detection**: 
  - **Isolation Forest**: For unsupervised anomaly detection (finding unknown threats).
  - **Random Forest**: For supervised attack classification (DDoS, Port Scanning, Brute Force).
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A web-based UI built with Flask to visualize threats and statistics.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates detailed security audit reports in Markdown.
- **Structured Alerting**: Calculates threat scores (0-100) and severity levels.
